Procedure:
User Input:
The user enters text (e.g., a paragraph, story, or lyrics) into the system.

Text Analysis:
The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the text's mood, tone, and sentiment (e.g., happy, sad, energetic).

Music Mapping:
Based on the analysis, the system maps the detected emotions to musical elements (tempo, scale, instruments, etc.).

Music Generation:
An AI music engine generates a short music piece reflecting the mood and structure of the text.

Playback & Preview:
The user can play, pause, and replay the generated music through an audio player interface.

Download & Share:
The user can download the music or share it via a link or social media.
