Application of COCOMO Model:
Effort Estimation:
COCOMO helps estimate the total effort (in person-months) required to develop the text-to-music system based on its size (lines of code or function points).

Project Planning:
It aids in planning phases like requirement analysis, design, coding, testing, and deployment by providing time estimates for each.

Cost Prediction:
Based on the estimated effort and development time, the model calculates the total cost of the project, including resources and tools.

Team Size Allocation:
It determines the optimal number of developers needed, avoiding under- or over-staffing issues.

Risk Management:
COCOMO identifies project risks by categorizing the system as Organic, Semi-Detached, or Embedded, which helps in risk mitigation and better planning.

Performance Benchmarking:
The model allows comparison with similar software projects, helping improve productivity and efficiency by setting realistic goals.
