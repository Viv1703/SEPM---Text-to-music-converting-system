COCOMO Basic Formula:
Effort (Person-Months) = a × (KLOC)^b
Development Time (Months) = c × (Effort)^d

a, b, c, d are constants based on the project type:
For a Semi-Detached project (moderate complexity AI-based system):

a = 3.0, b = 1.12, c = 2.5, d = 0.35

Assumptions:
Estimated size of the project = 15,000 lines of code (15 KLOC)

Developer cost = INR 80,000 per month

Step 1: Effort Estimation
Effort = 3.0 × (15)^1.12 ≈ 3.0 × 22.44 ≈ 67.32 Person-Months

Step 2: Time Estimation
Time = 2.5 × (67.32)^0.35 ≈ 2.5 × 4.49 ≈ 11.23 Months

Step 3: Cost Estimation
Total Cost = Effort × Cost per Month
= 67.32 × 80,000
= INR 53,85,600

Summary:
Estimated Effort: ~67 person-months

Development Time: ~11.2 months

Estimated Cost: ~INR 53.86 lakhs
