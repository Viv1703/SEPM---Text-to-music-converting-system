# SEPM---Text-to-music-converting-system
Problem Statement:

In the creative industry, transforming textual content such as emotions, stories, or moods into corresponding musical compositions remains a complex and manual process. Musicians and content creators often struggle to translate narrative themes or descriptive language into music that accurately reflects the intended sentiment or context. This gap limits accessibility for non-musicians and slows down content creation for professionals. There is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically generate music based on textual input, enabling users to quickly and intuitively produce expressive audio content aligned with their written ideas.

Functional Requirements:
Text Input: Allow users to input text (sentences, paragraphs, lyrics, etc.).

Text Analysis: Analyze the text to detect emotion, mood, tone, and theme.

Music Generation: Generate music based on the analyzed text using predefined rules or AI models.

Playback Feature: Enable users to play, pause, and stop the generated music.

Download Option: Allow users to download the generated music in common formats (e.g., MP3, WAV).

User Interface: Provide an intuitive interface for text input and interaction.

Save & Share: Enable users to save and share generated music.

Non-Functional Requirements:
Performance: The system should generate music within a few seconds of text input.

Scalability: Able to handle multiple user requests simultaneously.

Usability: Easy to use for non-technical users with a clean and simple UI.

Reliability: System should produce music consistently without crashes or failures.

Security: Protect user data and generated music files.

Accuracy: Music generated should reasonably reflect the text's mood and tone.

Portability: Should work across different devices and browsers (if web-based).
