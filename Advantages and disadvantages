Advantages:
Accurate Estimation:
Provides a structured and relatively accurate way to estimate effort, time, and cost based on project size.

Project Planning Aid:
Helps in breaking down the project lifecycle into phases, supporting better planning and scheduling.

Resource Management:
Assists in determining the required team size and timeline, optimizing resource allocation.

Risk Identification:
Highlights potential risks based on project complexity and type (organic, semi-detached, embedded).

Customizable:
The model can be adjusted with real-world project data for better accuracy over time.

Benchmarking Tool:
Useful for comparing with other similar projects to evaluate performance and efficiency.

Disadvantages:
Requires Accurate Inputs:
Estimates can be inaccurate if initial data (like LOC or complexity) is incorrect or unavailable.

Not Ideal for New Technologies:
Less effective for modern AI-based systems or non-traditional software where size and effort don’t directly correlate.

Static Model:
Doesn’t adapt well to rapid changes or evolving project requirements (common in creative AI systems).

Limited in Small Projects:
May be too complex or unnecessary for small-scale or quick development projects.

Assumes Waterfall Model:
Works best with traditional waterfall approaches and may not fit well with agile or iterative development.

No Quality Prediction:
It focuses on cost and effort but doesn’t directly account for software quality or user experience.
