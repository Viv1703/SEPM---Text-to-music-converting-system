1. Unit Testing:
Purpose: Test individual components or classes in isolation.

Examples:

Testing analyzeMood() function in NLPProcessor.

Verifying generateMusic() in MusicGenerator returns a valid MP3 file.

Ensuring submitFeedback() correctly stores user input.

2. Integration Testing:
Purpose: Test interaction between modules.

Examples:

Checking that TextInput successfully passes text to NLPProcessor.

Ensuring the MoodAnalyzer properly integrates with MusicGenerator.

Verifying the audio file returned is playable in the AudioPlayer.

3. System Testing:
Purpose: Validate the entire system works as intended.

Examples:

Full workflow: User enters text → mood analyzed → music generated → played.

Checking system behavior under different moods, languages, and text lengths.

Ensuring system handles errors gracefully (e.g., empty input, unsupported format).

4. Acceptance Testing:
Purpose: Ensure the system meets business requirements and user expectations.

Examples:

User feedback confirms music reflects emotional tone of input text.

Music plays correctly and feedback options work.

Tests performed by stakeholders or end-users to approve delivery.
